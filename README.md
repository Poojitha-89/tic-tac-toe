# Tic Tac Toe Game using Python and Tkinter




## OverView


This project is a classic implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game, developed using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The game allows two players to compete against each other on the same machine, marking their moves on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a tie.
## Key Features
1. Two-Player Game Mode:

    The game supports two players (Player X and Player O) taking turns to mark their positions on the grid.

    Players are indicated with symbols "X" and "O", and the game automatically switches turns between them.

2. GUI with Tkinter:

   The game features a clean and simple GUI using Tkinter, a built-in Python library for creating graphical interfaces.

    The grid is displayed with buttons, which update dynamically as players make their moves.

3. Winner Detection:

   The game includes logic to detect a winner when a player aligns three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

    The winning marks are highlighted, and the winner is announced on the screen.

4. Game Tie Detection:

   The game also detects a tie situation when all nine spots on the grid are filled without any winner.

5. Restart Game Option:

    A "Restart" button is provided to reset the game at any point, allowing players to start a new round.
